## Step 1: Prep PLINK files and run ADMIXTURE
Prerequsities are a reference file, e.g. the high coverage 1KG reference file `1KG_high_coverage_20130606_g1k_3202.merged` containing 26 subpopulations and 5 superpopulations. <br>
Your reference file should contain information about the ancestry of individuals e.g. in the FID, which is needed to create the `.pop` file for supervised ADMIXTURE ancestry inference. <br>
For more details check out the [ADMIXTURE manual](https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/admixture-manual.pdf).
Ideally, files are RICOPILI were QCed using the (RICOPILI)[https://github.com/Ripkelab/ricopili] `preimp_dir` and `pcaer` modules.

```bash
# replace PLINK prefix and output filename
 sbatch 1_run_admixture.sh your_bfile your_outname
```

## Step 2: Mapping ancestry in R
